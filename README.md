# Delight - PHP Framework for frontend elements

**Development has been discontinued and further use is not recommended.**

This project was a great learning experience for me and I formerly used it for a couple of personal projects. However, it does not meet my current standards for safety and code quality and I would not recommend using it for any new projects, especially not for production.

## About the project

Delight is a Framework for easy to use frontend elements such as form elements, toast notifications & many more.

The components are provided as PHP classes which can include the data and some configuration, depending on the component. The classes can then be rendered to HTML using the `render()` method, which outputs the HTML code and results in fully styled and functional elements.
